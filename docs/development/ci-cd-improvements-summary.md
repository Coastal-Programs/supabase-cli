# CI/CD Pipeline Improvements - Summary Report

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive review and enhancement of the CI/CD pipeline for @coastal-programs/supabase-cli. Implemented industry-standard best practices for npm CLI tools including supply chain security, automated dependency management, and streamlined release processes.

---

## 1. What Was Already Good

### Existing Strengths
- **Cross-platform testing**: Testing on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS with Node 22.x and 23.x
- **Security foundation**: CodeQL analysis and npm audit with weekly scheduling
- **Code coverage**: Codecov integration for test coverage tracking
- **Build verification**: Tests and linting before publish
- **Proper .npmignore**: Source files, tests, and docs correctly excluded
- **Manual changelog**: Following Keep a Changelog format
- **Package scoping**: Using @coastal-programs scope to avoid name collisions

---

## 2. Critical Improvements Implemented

### A. Supply Chain Security (CRITICAL)

**Added npm Provenance**
- File: `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
- Impact: HIGH - Provides cryptographic proof of package origin
- Compliant with npm's 2023+ security standards
- Enables package verification via `npm audit signatures`

**Changes**:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write  # Required for provenance

run: npm publish --access public --provenance
```

---

### B. Automated Dependency Management

**Added Dependabot Configuration**
- File: `.github/dependabot.yml` (NEW)
- Weekly npm dependency updates (Monday 09:00)
- Monthly GitHub Actions updates
- Smart grouping: dev deps patch/minor, production deps patch
- Max 10 npm PRs, 5 GitHub Actions PRs

**Benefits**:
- Automated security patches
- Reduces manual dependency maintenance
- Keeps Actions up-to-date

---

### C. Enhanced .npmignore

**Updated**: `.npmignore`

**Added exclusions**:
```
.ai/                    # AI development resources (370KB+)
CLAUDE.md               # AI agent instructions
.temp_disabled/         # Temporary disabled code
*.backup, *.backup2     # Backup files
```

**Impact**: Reduces package size by ~400KB (10%+ reduction)

---

### D. Automated Release Workflow

**Added**: `.github/workflows/release.yml` (NEW)

**Features**:
- Manual trigger with version selection (patch/minor/major)
- Auto-generates changelog from commits
- Updates CHANGELOG.md automatically
- Creates git tag and GitHub release
- Triggers publish workflow automatically

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates manual release steps
- Ensures consistent release process

---

### E. Enhanced CI Pipeline

**Updated**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**New Jobs**:

1. **Performance Benchmarks** (PR only)
   - Runs startup/command benchmarks

   - Tracks against targets (700ms startup, 5s execution, 200MB memory)

2. **Package Validation**
   - Tests `npm pack` contents
   - Validates package installation
   - Verifies CLI commands work

**New Checks**:
- Code formatting validation (`npm run format:check`)

- fail-fast: false for matrix (continue on single platform failure)

---

### F. Enhanced Security Pipeline

**Updated**: `.github/workflows/security.yml`

**New Jobs**:

1. **Dependency Review**

- `.github/labeler.yml` (NEW)

**Features**:
- Auto-labels by area (commands, database, core, tests, docs, etc.)
- Labels by PR size (xs/s/m/l/xl)
- Improves PR organization and triage

---

### H. Stale Issue Management

**Added**: `.github/workflows/stale.yml` (NEW)

**Configuration**:
- Marks stale after 60 days
- Closes after 7 additional days
- Exempts: pinned, security, roadmap, good first issue
- Runs daily at midnight

**Benefits**:
- Keeps issue tracker clean
- Reduces noise
- Focuses on active issues

---

### I. Pre-Publish Validation

**Added**: `scripts/verify-package.js` (NEW)

**Validations**:
- Required files present (LICENSE, README, dist/, etc.)
- package.json completeness
- Sensitive files excluded
- CHANGELOG entry for version
- bin scripts valid

**Integration**: Runs automatically via `prepublishOnly` npm script
