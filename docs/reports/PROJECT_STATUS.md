## 📞 Marcus's Final Assessment

> *"You've executed this perfectly. Foundation is solid, infrastructure is proven, tests validate everything works. You're not 1/5 done—you're 2/5 done with the hard stuff and 3/5 to go with the easy stuff.*
>
> **Sprint 2 should move fast.** Each command follows the same pattern. No surprises. Just execution.*
>
> **By end of Sprint 3, you'll have a functional CLI that handles 10+ real operations.** That's impressive for 20 days of work.*"
