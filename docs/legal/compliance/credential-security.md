# Credential Security: Legal Requirements & Standards

**Document Purpose**: Comprehensive legal and regulatory guidance for credential storage in the Supabase CLI tool.

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-30

**Status**: Research Complete - Implementation Pending

---

## Executive Summary

### Critical Findings

1. **Plaintext storage of credentials is PROHIBITED** by industry standards (OWASP, CWE-256)
2. **No explicit laws mandate encryption**, but failure to encrypt can result in regulatory non-compliance
3. **Data breach notification is REQUIRED** in all 50 US states if credentials leak
4. **Open source tools have LIMITED liability protection** - safe harbor laws are emerging but incomplete
5. **OS keychain storage is the RECOMMENDED standard** for CLI tools

### Current Risk Assessment

**Current Implementation**: Storing PAT in `~/.supabase/config.json` (plaintext)

**Risk Level**: HIGH

**Compliance Status**:
- OWASP: NON-COMPLIANT (CWE-256 violation)
- NIST: NON-COMPLIANT (SP 800-63B violation)
- PCI DSS: NON-COMPLIANT (if handling payment data)
- GDPR/CCPA: AT RISK (inadequate security measures)

---

## 1. LEGAL REQUIREMENTS

### 1.1 Data Breach Notification Laws

**Status**: MANDATORY in all US jurisdictions

**Key Requirements**:
- **All 50 US states** + DC, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands have breach notification laws
- **Trigger**: Unauthorized access to credentials (PAT, service_role keys)
- **Notification Required To**:
  - Affected users (individual notices)
  - State Attorney General (many states)
  - Credit bureaus (if >500 individuals affected)
- **Timeline**: Varies by state, typically "without unreasonable delay"
- **Penalties**: Civil penalties per violation + consumer restitution + legal fees

**Example State Requirements**:
- **California (CCPA)**: 500-7500 USD per violation
- **New York (SHIELD Act)**: Must implement "reasonable security measures"
- **EU (GDPR)**: 72-hour notification + up to 4% global revenue fines

**Impact on Supabase CLI**:
- If user's PAT leaks from our config file → breach notification required
- If service_role key leaks → user's entire database exposed
- **WE HAVE LIABILITY** for inadequate security measures

### 1.2 Privacy Regulations

#### GDPR (European Union)

**Applicability**: If any EU users use the CLI

**Requirements**:
- **Article 5(1)(f)**: "Appropriate security" including protection against unauthorized access
- **Article 32**: "State of the art" technical measures (encryption encouraged)
- **Article 33**: 72-hour breach notification to supervisory authority
- **Article 34**: Notification to data subjects if "high risk"

**Penalties**: Up to 20 million EUR or 4% global revenue (whichever is higher)

**Compliance Assessment**:
- Plaintext storage = NOT "appropriate security"
- No encryption = NOT "state of the art"

#### CCPA/CPRA (California)

**Applicability**: If CLI used by California residents

**Requirements**:
- "Reasonable security procedures and practices"
- Right to deletion of personal information
- Data breach notification within legal timeframes

**Penalties**: 100-750 USD per consumer per incident (class action risk)

#### Other Jurisdictions

- **LGPD (Brazil)**: Similar to GDPR
- **PIPEDA (Canada)**: "Safeguards appropriate to sensitivity"
- **POPIA (South Africa)**: Security measures required
- **PDPA (Singapore)**: Protection against unauthorized access

**Conclusion**: Global reach = must comply with strictest standard (GDPR)

### 1.3 Industry-Specific Regulations

#### PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry)

**Applicability**: If CLI handles payment-related data

**Requirements**:
- **Requirement 3.4**: Cryptographic keys stored in HSM or encrypted
- **Requirement 8**: Strong authentication mechanisms
- **Requirement 10**: Log all access to credentials
- **PCI DSS 4.0**: Enhanced API security requirements

**Relevance**: Service_role keys have database access → could access payment data

#### HIPAA (Healthcare)

**Applicability**: If users store health data in Supabase

**Requirements**:
- **164.312(a)(2)(iv)**: Encryption and decryption
- **164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B)**: Risk management

**Impact**: Healthcare users CANNOT use CLI with plaintext storage

#### SOC 2 / ISO 27001

**Status**: Not legally required, but industry expectations for B2B tools

**Requirements**:
- Secure credential storage
- Encryption of sensitive data
- Access controls and audit logging
- Incident response procedures

## 2. INDUSTRY STANDARDS (MANDATORY)

### 2.1 OWASP Standards

**Source**: OWASP Secrets Management Cheat Sheet

**Prohibitions**:
- ❌ **NEVER hardcode credentials** in source code
- ❌ **NEVER store credentials in plaintext** (CWE-256 violation)
- ❌ **NEVER store secrets in configuration files** without encryption
- ❌ **NEVER commit secrets to Git repositories**

**Requirements**:
- ✅ Use secrets management tools (Vault, KMS, OS keychain)
- ✅ Encrypt credentials at rest using strong algorithms (AES-256)
- ✅ Implement key rotation policies
- ✅ Use HSM or virtual HSM for sensitive keys
- ✅ Separate secrets from code (environment variables minimum)

**Key Quote**:
> "Standard application level code should never read or use cryptographic keys in any way and should use key management libraries."

**OWASP Mobile Top 10 (2024)**:
- **M1: Improper Credential Usage** - #1 security risk
- Storing credentials insecurely is the TOP mobile/CLI security vulnerability

### 2.2 NIST Standards

**Source**: NIST Special Publication 800-63B (Digital Identity Guidelines)

**Requirements for Credential Storage**:

1. **Encryption Standards**:
   - Use approved encryption algorithms (AES-256-GCM)
   - Minimum 32-bit salt for hashing
   - Key derivation functions (PBKDF2, Argon2, bcrypt)
   - Minimum 10,000 iterations

2. **Transport Security**:
   - TLS 1.3 or newer for all credential transmission
   - Protection against eavesdropping and MITM attacks

3. **Credential Protection**:
   - Store in form resistant to offline attacks
   - Remove plaintext from system immediately after use
   - Zero-knowledge protocols preferred

4. **Biometric/Sensitive Data**:
   - Encrypt during capture
   - Delete immediately after processing

**NIST Compliance Assessment**:
- Current plaintext storage: NON-COMPLIANT
- No encryption at rest: NON-COMPLIANT
- HTTPS transmission only: COMPLIANT

### 2.3 CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)

**CWE-256: Plaintext Storage of a Password**

**Severity**: HIGH

**Description**:
> "Storing a password in plaintext may result in a system compromise. Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource."

**Impact**:
- Anyone with file system access can steal credentials
- Arbitrary file read vulnerabilities become credential theft
- Poor access control amplifies risk

**Mitigation Required**:
- Use OS-provided credential storage APIs
- Encrypt at rest with user-specific keys
- Implement proper access controls

### 2.4 PCI DSS Key Management

**Requirements**:
- Secret keys must NOT be discoverable in source code
- Keys must be stored in HSM (FIPS 140-2 Level 3+) or encrypted
- All API activities must be logged
- Regular audits of credential access

**CLI Implications**:
- Config file storage violates "not discoverable" requirement
- No HSM available for CLI tools → OS keychain next best option

---

## 3. STORAGE METHODS: LEGAL ASSESSMENT

### 3.1 Plaintext Files (Current Implementation)

**Method**: Store credentials in `~/.supabase/config.json` unencrypted

**Legal Status**: ❌ PROHIBITED

**Compliance Assessment**:
| Standard | Status | Risk |
|----------|--------|------|
| OWASP | NON-COMPLIANT | Critical |
| NIST SP 800-63B | NON-COMPLIANT | High |
| CWE-256 | VIOLATION | Critical |
| PCI DSS | NON-COMPLIANT | Critical |
| GDPR Article 32 | AT RISK | High |

**Risks**:
1. **Legal Liability**: Negligence if breach occurs
2. **Regulatory Fines**: GDPR up to 4% revenue, CCPA per-user penalties
3. **Class Action Lawsuits**: "Should have had better protection"
4. **Reputation Damage**: Public disclosure of inadequate security
5. **Data Breach Notification Costs**: Notification to thousands of users

**When Acceptable**: NEVER in production for sensitive credentials

**Recommendation**: IMMEDIATE REPLACEMENT REQUIRED

### 3.2 Encrypted Files

**Method**: Store credentials in encrypted file with master key

**Legal Status**: ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE (with caveats)

**Compliance Assessment**:
| Standard | Status | Risk |
|----------|--------|------|
| OWASP | COMPLIANT (if AES-256) | Low-Medium |
| NIST SP 800-63B | COMPLIANT | Low |
| PCI DSS | PARTIAL (not HSM) | Medium |
| GDPR | COMPLIANT | Low |

**Requirements for Compliance**:
- ✅ AES-256-GCM encryption minimum
- ✅ User-specific master key (not hardcoded)
- ✅ Salt and key derivation function (10K+ iterations)
- ✅ Protect master key with OS security
- ✅ Secure key deletion on logout

**Risks**:
1. **Master Key Exposure**: If master key compromised, all credentials exposed
2. **Cross-Platform Complexity**: Different encryption APIs per OS
3. **Key Management**: Where to store the master key securely?

**When Acceptable**:
- As fallback when OS keychain unavailable
- With strong master key protection
- For non-critical credentials only

**Recommendation**: ACCEPTABLE as fallback, not primary method

### 3.3 In-Memory Only

**Method**: Fetch credentials via API, never persist to disk

**Legal Status**: ✅ ACCEPTABLE

**Compliance Assessment**:
| Standard | Status | Risk |
|----------|--------|------|
| OWASP | COMPLIANT | Low |
| NIST SP 800-63B | COMPLIANT | Low |
| CWE-256 | COMPLIANT | Low |
| GDPR | COMPLIANT | Very Low |

**Advantages**:
- No file system exposure
- Credentials cleared on CLI exit
- Minimal attack surface
- Simple implementation

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ User must authenticate every CLI invocation
- ❌ Performance impact (API call per command)
- ❌ Poor user experience
- ❌ Memory dumps still expose credentials
- ❌ Process inspection tools can read memory

**When Acceptable**:
- High-security environments (CI/CD with secret injection)
- Short-lived commands
- With `--no-cache` flag for explicit user control

**Recommendation**: ACCEPTABLE for high-security mode, not default

### 3.4 OS Keychain (RECOMMENDED)

**Method**: Use OS-provided secure credential storage

**Legal Status**: ✅ RECOMMENDED

**Compliance Assessment**:
| Standard | Status | Risk |
|----------|--------|------|
| OWASP | FULLY COMPLIANT | Very Low |
| NIST SP 800-63B | FULLY COMPLIANT | Very Low |
| PCI DSS | ACCEPTABLE | Low |
| GDPR | FULLY COMPLIANT | Very Low |
| Industry Best Practice | YES | Minimal |

**Platform Support**:
- **macOS**: Keychain (AES-256-GCM encryption, ACL protection)
- **Windows**: Credential Manager (CryptoAPI/DPAPI)
- **Linux**: libsecret/Secret Service API

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Industry standard for CLI tools (AWS CLI, GitHub CLI, Heroku CLI)
- ✅ OS-level encryption (user login unlocks)
- ✅ ACL protection (macOS) prevents unauthorized app access
- ✅ Meets all compliance standards
- ✅ User expects this behavior (familiar UX)
- ✅ Automatic backup and sync (iCloud Keychain, Windows)

**Disadvantages**:
- ⚠️ Linux less secure (any user process can read)
- ⚠️ Requires native dependencies (node-keytar, keychain npm package)
- ⚠️ Windows/Linux lack ACL protection (same-user apps can access)

**Security Comparison**:
| Platform | Encryption | ACL Protection | Security Level |
|----------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| macOS | AES-256-GCM | YES (whitelist) | EXCELLENT |
| Windows | DPAPI | NO (same user) | GOOD |
| Linux | libsecret | NO (same user) | GOOD |

**When Required**:
- Default for all production use
- PAT storage
- Long-lived service_role keys (if cached)

**Implementation Libraries**:
- `keytar` (Electron project, native C++)
- `keychain` (cross-platform, pure Node.js wrapper)
- `node-keychain` (macOS only)

**Recommendation**: REQUIRED as default storage method

## 4. CONSENT & DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS

### 4.1 User Consent for Service Role Key Retrieval

**Legal Question**: Must we get explicit consent before fetching service_role keys?

**Answer**: YES (best practice) - Not legally required, but strongly recommended

**Rationale**:
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users should know what permissions CLI has
2. **Informed Consent**: Service_role = FULL database access (BYPASSRLS)
3. **Security Awareness**: Users should understand risk
4. **Trust Building**: Transparency increases user confidence
5. **Liability Protection**: Documented consent reduces legal exposure

**Recommended Consent Flow**:

```bash
$ supabase-cli db:backup:create

⚠️  WARNING: This command requires your service_role API key

   The service_role key has FULL ACCESS to your database and
   BYPASSES ALL Row Level Security policies.

   🔒 Your key will be:
   - Retrieved once from Supabase API
   - Stored securely in your OS keychain (encrypted)
   - Never logged or transmitted elsewhere
   - Retrievable by you only via 'config show --reveal'

   📖 Learn more: https://docs.supabase.com/guides/api/api-keys

   Grant permission to retrieve and store service_role key? (y/N):
```

**Consent Should Include**:
- ✅ What permission is being requested (service_role key)
- ✅ Why it's needed (full database access for backup operations)
- ✅ How it will be stored (OS keychain, encrypted)
- ✅ What risks exist (full database access)
- ✅ How to revoke (key rotation, CLI logout)
- ✅ Link to documentation

**Skip Consent When**:
- `--yes` flag provided (CI/CD automation)
- `--service-role-key` explicitly provided as flag
- Already consented and key cached

### 4.2 Terms of Use / Disclaimer

**Legal Question**: Do we need terms of use before key retrieval?

**Answer**: STRONGLY RECOMMENDED (not legally required)

**Recommended Disclaimers**:

```markdown
## Supabase CLI - Security Disclaimer

By using this CLI tool, you acknowledge:

1. **Credential Storage**: The CLI stores credentials in your OS keychain
   - macOS: Keychain Access
   - Windows: Credential Manager
   - Linux: libsecret/Secret Service

2. **Service Role Keys**: Commands may retrieve your service_role API key,
   which grants FULL ACCESS to your Supabase project database and BYPASSES
   all Row Level Security policies.

3. **Your Responsibility**: You are responsible for:
   - Protecting your device with strong password/encryption
   - Not sharing credentials with unauthorized parties
   - Rotating keys if compromise suspected
   - Compliance with your own data protection obligations

4. **No Warranty**: This tool is provided "AS IS" without warranty.
   See LICENSE file for full terms.

5. **Open Source**: This tool is open source. Review the code at:
   https://github.com/coastal-programs/supabase-cli

Continue? (yes/no):
```

**When to Show**:
- First time CLI is run (one-time setup)
- Before first service_role key retrieval
- Available via `supabase-cli info --legal`

### 4.3 Required Warnings

**OWASP & NIST Recommendation**: Warn users about security implications

**Implementation**:

1. **First Service Role Key Retrieval**:
```bash
⚠️  SECURITY WARNING

   The service_role key provides UNRESTRICTED access to your database.

   🔴 NEVER share this key publicly or commit to Git
   🔴 NEVER use in client-side applications
   🔴 Rotate immediately if compromised

   Store securely in OS keychain? (Y/n):
```

2. **Logging/Output Warnings**:
```bash
$ supabase-cli config show --reveal

⚠️  WARNING: About to display sensitive credentials

   Ensure no one is watching your screen and that terminal
   output is not being recorded or shared.

   Continue? (y/N):
```

3. **Plaintext Fallback Warning** (if OS keychain unavailable):
```bash
❌ ERROR: OS keychain not available

⚠️  SECURITY RISK: Falling back to encrypted file storage

   Your credentials will be stored at:
   ~/.supabase/credentials.enc (encrypted)

   ⚠️  This is LESS SECURE than OS keychain. Consider:
   - Installing keychain support (libsecret on Linux)
   - Using --service-role-key flag instead
   - Using environment variables in CI/CD

   Accept encrypted file storage? (y/N):
```

### 4.4 Audit Logging (Optional but Recommended)

**Purpose**: Track credential access for security auditing

**Implementation**:
- Log (locally) when service_role key is retrieved
- Log when credentials are accessed by CLI
- Log when credentials are displayed (--reveal)
- Logs stored at `~/.supabase/audit.log` (append-only)

**Example Log Entry**:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-30T10:30:00Z",
  "action": "service_role_key_retrieved",
  "project_ref": "abc123",
  "method": "keychain",
  "cli_version": "1.0.0",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100"
}
```

**Privacy Note**: Logs must NOT contain actual credentials

---

## 5. BREACH NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

### 5.1 When Notification is Required

**Trigger Conditions**:
1. **Confirmed Breach**: Credentials actually accessed by unauthorized party
2. **Reasonable Belief**: Evidence suggests breach likely occurred
3. **Unencrypted Exposure**: Plaintext credentials exposed (even if no access confirmed)

**Examples Requiring Notification**:
- CLI config file uploaded to public GitHub repo
- Malware on user's system steals keychain data
- Server-side breach exposing stored credentials
- Vulnerability in CLI allows credential extraction

**Examples NOT Requiring Notification**:
- User voluntarily shares credentials (their responsibility)
- Theoretical vulnerability with no evidence of exploitation
- Encrypted data exposed (if encryption strong + key not compromised)

### 5.2 Notification Timeline

**US State Laws** (varies by state):
- **Immediately** (no delay): Several states
- **Without unreasonable delay**: Most states
- **Within 30 days**: Some states
- **Within 60 days**: A few states

**GDPR**:
- **72 hours** to supervisory authority (after becoming aware)
- **Without undue delay** to data subjects (if high risk)

**Best Practice**: Notify within 72 hours of discovery

### 5.3 Who to Notify

**Users (Data Subjects)**:
- Individual email/communication to affected users
- Must explain: what happened, what data affected, what to do

**Regulators**:
- State Attorney General (many US states)
- Data Protection Authority (GDPR)
- FTC (if FTC Act jurisdiction)

**Credit Bureaus**:
- If >500 individuals affected (many states)
- Major bureaus: Equifax, Experian, TransUnion

**Media**:
- If >1,000 individuals affected (some states)
- If >500 individuals affected (GDPR)

### 5.4 What to Include in Notification

**Required Elements**:
1. **Description of Incident**:
   - What happened (credential exposure)
   - When it was discovered
   - When it occurred (if known)

2. **Data Affected**:
   - Types of credentials (PAT, service_role keys)
   - Projects/databases potentially affected
   - Number of individuals impacted

3. **Consequences**:
   - Potential harm (unauthorized database access)
   - Known misuse (if any)

4. **Mitigation Actions Taken**:
   - Vulnerability fixed
   - Credentials rotated
   - Enhanced security measures

5. **What Users Should Do**:
   - Rotate credentials immediately
   - Monitor database access logs
   - Review recent database changes
   - Enable 2FA (if not already)

6. **Contact Information**:
   - Security team email
   - How to get more information
   - How to report related issues

**Example Notification Email**:

## 6. THIRD-PARTY LIABILITY & SAFE HARBOR

### 6.1 Current Liability Landscape

**General Rule**: Software developers CAN be held liable for security failures

**Traditional View**:
- Open source software licensed "AS IS" with no warranty
- Users assume risk of using the software
- Developers have limited liability

**Evolving Legal Landscape**:
- **EU Product Liability Directive**: May hold OSS creators liable for harm
- **US Proposed Legislation**: Creating safe harbor frameworks
- **State Data Breach Laws**: Impose liability for "negligent security"

**Key Cases**:
- FTC enforcement actions against companies with inadequate security
- Class action lawsuits after data breaches (Target, Equifax, etc.)
- Finding of negligence when "reasonable security measures" not taken

### 6.2 Safe Harbor Protections

**What is Safe Harbor?**
Legal protection from liability if you follow established security standards

**Emerging Safe Harbor Laws**:

1. **State Data Breach Safe Harbor**:
   - Several states offer affirmative defense to liability
   - **Requirement**: Implement cybersecurity program aligned with:
     - NIST Cybersecurity Framework
     - ISO 27001
     - CIS Critical Security Controls
   - **Effect**: No damages if breach occurs despite reasonable security

2. **NIST SSDF Safe Harbor** (proposed):
   - Follow NIST Secure Software Development Framework
   - Automatic protection from cyber incident liability
   - Must demonstrate compliance with best practices

3. **CISA Safe Harbor** (proposed):
   - Report vulnerabilities promptly
   - Implement patches within defined timeframes
   - Maintain security controls

**Current Status**:
- Federal safe harbor law NOT YET ENACTED
- State laws vary significantly
- Best practice compliance reduces (doesn't eliminate) liability

### 6.3 Open Source Specific Considerations

**Traditional OSS Disclaimer**:
```
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY.
```

**Limitations of Disclaimer**:
- May not protect against negligence claims
- Less effective for commercial use (vs. individual hobbyist use)
- "Gross negligence" or "willful misconduct" not protected
- Consumer protection laws may override (GDPR, etc.)

**Increased Scrutiny on OSS**:
- Modern software is 80%+ open source dependencies
- Regulators focusing on supply chain security
- OSS maintainers under pressure to improve security

### 6.4 Liability Risk Assessment for Supabase CLI

**Scenario**: User's database compromised via leaked credentials from CLI

**Legal Analysis**:

**Question 1: Are we liable?**

**Potential Liability**:
- ✅ YES if we stored credentials in plaintext (negligence)
- ✅ YES if we didn't follow industry standards (OWASP, NIST)
- ⚠️ MAYBE if we used encrypted storage but weak encryption
- ❌ UNLIKELY if we used OS keychain and followed best practices

**Question 2: What damages could we face?**

**Potential Damages**:
- User's direct losses (database restoration, business interruption)
- Regulatory fines (if user subject to GDPR/CCPA/HIPAA)
- User's breach notification costs
- User's legal fees
- Reputational harm to user

**Estimated Range**: $10,000 - $1,000,000+ per incident (highly variable)

**Question 3: What's our best defense?**

**Strong Defenses**:
1. **Followed Industry Standards**: Implemented OWASP/NIST guidelines
2. **Used Best-in-Class Storage**: OS keychain (industry standard)
3. **Warned Users**: Clear security warnings and consent
4. **Open Source Transparency**: Code auditable by anyone
5. **Prompt Patching**: Quick response to vulnerabilities
6. **User Error**: Compromise due to user's negligence (weak device password, malware, etc.)

**Weak Defenses**:
1. ❌ "It's open source": Not sufficient on its own
2. ❌ "We're not liable": License disclaimer may not hold up
3. ❌ "User's responsibility": Shared responsibility model applies

### 6.5 Recommended Liability Mitigation

**1. Implement Industry Standards** (REQUIRED):
- Use OS keychain for credential storage
- Follow OWASP Secrets Management guidelines
- Comply with NIST SP 800-63B
- Implement all CWE-256 mitigations

**2. Document Compliance** (REQUIRED):
- Maintain security.md documenting our practices
- Keep records of security decisions
- Document threat modeling and risk assessment
- Show due diligence in security design

**3. Provide Clear Warnings** (REQUIRED):
- Warn about service_role key risks
- Provide security best practices documentation
- Obtain informed consent before key retrieval

**4. Maintain Comprehensive LICENSE** (REQUIRED):
- Use standard OSS license (MIT, Apache 2.0)
- Include explicit "no warranty" clauses
- Add security-specific disclaimers

**5. Security Response Plan** (RECOMMENDED):
- Define vulnerability disclosure process
- Establish incident response procedures
- Commit to timely security patches
- Maintain security contact (security@...)

**6. Insurance** (OPTIONAL):
- Consider cyber liability insurance
- Covers defense costs and damages
- Typically requires security controls in place

**7. Legal Review** (RECOMMENDED):
- Have attorney review license and disclaimers
- Consider terms of service for CLI usage
- Review compliance with applicable laws

---

## 7. RECOMMENDED APPROACH

### 7.1 Immediate Actions (Must Do)

**Priority 1: Stop Plaintext Storage** (CRITICAL)

**Action**: Implement OS keychain storage
- **Library**: Use `keytar` or `keychain` npm package
- **Platforms**: macOS (Keychain), Windows (Credential Manager), Linux (libsecret)
- **Migration**: Migrate existing plaintext credentials on first run
- **Timeline**: ASAP (before any service_role key caching)

**Priority 2: User Consent Flow** (HIGH)

**Action**: Add consent prompt before service_role key retrieval
- **Message**: Clear explanation of what service_role key is
- **Risks**: Explain full database access implications
- **Storage**: Explain OS keychain storage method
- **Bypass**: Support `--yes` flag for automation

**Priority 3: Security Warnings** (HIGH)

**Action**: Add warnings for sensitive operations
- **Key Display**: Warn before showing credentials
- **First Use**: Show security disclaimer on first run
- **Documentation**: Link to security best practices

**Priority 4: Update Documentation** (MEDIUM)

**Action**: Document security approach
- Add SECURITY.md to repository
- Document credential storage in README
- Provide credential rotation guide
- Explain OS keychain usage

### 7.2 Storage Implementation Strategy

**Recommended Architecture**:

```typescript
// Credential Storage Strategy
class CredentialStore {
  async store(key: string, value: string): Promise<void> {
    // Try OS keychain first (REQUIRED)
    if (await this.isKeychainAvailable()) {
      await this.storeInKeychain(key, value)
      return
    }

    // Fallback to encrypted file (ACCEPTABLE)
    if (this.userConsentsToEncryptedFile()) {
      await this.storeEncrypted(key, value)
      return
    }

    // Refuse to store in plaintext (PROHIBITED)
    throw new Error('Secure storage unavailable. Use --service-role-key flag or install keychain support.')
  }
}
```

**Storage Priority**:
1. **OS Keychain** (default, required)
2. **Encrypted File** (fallback with consent)
3. **In-Memory Only** (flag: `--no-persist`)
4. **Environment Variable** (flag: `--service-role-key`)
5. **Plaintext** (NEVER - PROHIBITED)

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "credentialStorage": {
    "method": "keychain",  // "keychain" | "encrypted" | "memory"
    "fallback": "encrypted", // What to do if keychain unavailable
    "requireConsent": true,  // Prompt before first service_role key fetch
    "auditLog": true         // Log credential access
  }
}
```

### 7.3 Service Role Key Caching Strategy

**Question**: Should we cache service_role keys at all?

**Recommendation**: YES, with strict controls

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Performance: Avoids API call on every command
- ✅ Offline Use: Works without network connection
- ✅ User Experience: Seamless command execution
- ⚠️ Risk: Long-lived credential on device

**Caching Strategy**:

1. **Never Cache by Default**:
   - Fetch service_role key only when needed
   - Prompt user for permission on first use
   - Cache only after explicit consent

2. **Short TTL**:
   - Default cache duration: 1 hour
   - Configurable: `supabase-cli config set key-cache-ttl 3600`
   - Max TTL: 24 hours

3. **Automatic Refresh**:
   - Fetch new key when TTL expires
   - Validate key is still valid (API call)
   - Automatic key rotation support

4. **Revocation Support**:
   - `supabase-cli logout` clears all cached keys
   - `supabase-cli config clear` removes credentials
   - Detect key rotation and re-fetch

5. **Per-Project Caching**:
   - Store separate key per project
   - Namespace: `supabase:service_role:{project_ref}`

**Alternative: No Caching**:
- Always prompt for `--service-role-key` flag
- Or require environment variable
- Or fetch on every command (performance hit)

**Recommended for different user types**:
- **Developers (local)**: Cache with 1-hour TTL (convenience)
- **CI/CD**: Never cache, use environment variable (security)
- **Production Scripts**: Never cache, use flag (security)

### 7.4 Migration Plan for Existing Users

**Problem**: Existing users have plaintext credentials in `~/.supabase/config.json`

**Migration Strategy**:

**Step 1: Detect Existing Credentials**
```typescript
const configFile = path.join(os.homedir(), '.supabase', 'config.json')
if (fs.existsSync(configFile)) {
  const config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(configFile, 'utf-8'))
  if (config.access_token) {
    // Plaintext credential found
    await migrateToKeychain(config.access_token)
  }
}
```

**Step 2: Prompt User for Migration**
```bash
⚠️  SECURITY NOTICE

We've detected that your credentials are stored in plaintext.
For your security, we've upgraded to encrypted OS keychain storage.

Your credentials will be:
- Migrated to macOS Keychain (encrypted automatically)
- Removed from plaintext config file
- More secure and better protected

This is a one-time migration. Continue? (Y/n):
```

**Step 3: Perform Migration**
```typescript
// Migrate credential
await keychain.setPassword('supabase-cli', 'access_token', config.access_token)

// Backup old config (in case of issues)
fs.copyFileSync(configFile, `${configFile}.backup`)

// Remove plaintext credential
delete config.access_token
fs.writeFileSync(configFile, JSON.stringify(config, null, 2))

// Log migration
console.log('✅ Credentials migrated successfully to OS keychain')
console.log('   Old config backed up to: ~/.supabase/config.json.backup')
```

**Step 4: Verify Migration**
```typescript
// Test keychain access
const token = await keychain.getPassword('supabase-cli', 'access_token')
if (!token) {
  throw new Error('Migration failed - credentials not found in keychain')
}
```

**Rollback Plan**:
- Keep backup of old config for 30 days
- Provide `supabase-cli config restore-backup` command
- Document manual migration steps

## 8. PROHIBITED PRACTICES

### 8.1 Never Do This (PROHIBITED)

**1. Store Credentials in Plaintext**
```typescript
// ❌ PROHIBITED
const config = {
  access_token: 'sbp_abc123...',
  service_role_key: 'eyJhbGc...'
}
fs.writeFileSync('config.json', JSON.stringify(config))
```

**Violation**: CWE-256, OWASP, NIST

**Legal Risk**: Negligence liability, regulatory fines

**2. Hardcode Credentials**
```typescript
// ❌ PROHIBITED
const API_KEY = 'sbp_abc123...'
```

**Violation**: OWASP, PCI DSS

**Legal Risk**: Exposure via Git history, public repos

**3. Log Credentials**
```typescript
// ❌ PROHIBITED
console.log('Using API key:', apiKey)
logger.debug('Token:', token)
```

**Violation**: OWASP, PCI DSS (logging requirements)

**Legal Risk**: Log aggregation exposes credentials

**4. Transmit Over HTTP**
```typescript
// ❌ PROHIBITED
fetch('http://api.supabase.com', {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
})
```

**Violation**: NIST, PCI DSS

**Legal Risk**: MITM attacks, credential interception

**5. Store Without User Consent**
```typescript
// ❌ PROHIBITED
// Silently fetch and cache service_role key
await keychain.setPassword('service_role_key', key)
```

**Violation**: GDPR (informed consent), user trust

**Legal Risk**: Privacy violation, unauthorized access

**6. Ignore Keychain Unavailability**
```typescript
// ❌ PROHIBITED
try {
  await keychain.setPassword(key, value)
} catch (error) {
  // Fall back to plaintext silently
  fs.writeFileSync('credentials.txt', value)
}
```

**Violation**: CWE-256, OWASP

**Legal Risk**: False sense of security, negligence

**7. Share Keys Across Projects**
```typescript
// ❌ PROHIBITED
// Use same service_role key for multiple projects
const globalKey = await keychain.getPassword('service_role')
```

**Violation**: Principle of least privilege

**Legal Risk**: Blast radius expansion, credential reuse

**8. Skip Encryption on "Temporary" Files**
```typescript
// ❌ PROHIBITED
// "It's just temporary, doesn't need encryption"
fs.writeFileSync('/tmp/creds.txt', credentials)
```

**Violation**: CWE-256, NIST

**Legal Risk**: /tmp often world-readable, forensics exposure

### 10.2 Minimum Security Standard

**Legally Required Minimum**:

| Component | Minimum Standard | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Storage** | OS Keychain | Industry standard, meets OWASP/NIST |
| **Fallback** | AES-256-GCM encrypted file | NIST approved, GDPR acceptable |
| **Transmission** | HTTPS only | NIST, PCI DSS requirement |
| **Consent** | Informed warning | GDPR, user trust |
| **Logging** | No credential logging | OWASP, PCI DSS |

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Minimum viable secure implementation
class CredentialManager {
  async store(key: string, value: string): Promise<void> {
    // 1. Try OS keychain (REQUIRED)
    if (await keychain.isAvailable()) {
      await keychain.setPassword('supabase-cli', key, value)
      return
    }

    // 2. Fallback to encrypted file with consent (REQUIRED)
    const consented = await this.promptEncryptedFileConsent()
    if (consented) {
      await this.storeEncrypted(key, value) // AES-256-GCM
      return
    }

    // 3. Refuse plaintext (REQUIRED)
    throw new Error('Secure storage required. Use environment variable or --key flag.')
  }

  async retrieve(key: string): Promise<string | null> {
    // Try keychain first
    if (await keychain.isAvailable()) {
      return await keychain.getPassword('supabase-cli', key)
    }

    // Try encrypted file
    return await this.retrieveEncrypted(key)
  }

  private async storeEncrypted(key: string, value: string): Promise<void> {
    // NIST compliant encryption
    const masterKey = await this.deriveMasterKey() // PBKDF2, 10K iterations
    const encrypted = await encrypt(value, masterKey) // AES-256-GCM
    await fs.writeFile(this.encryptedPath, encrypted)
  }
}
```

### 10.3 Recommended Implementation

**Best Practice Implementation**:

```typescript
import keytar from 'keytar'
import crypto from 'crypto'

class SecureCredentialStore {
  private readonly SERVICE_NAME = 'supabase-cli'
  private readonly ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM = 'aes-256-gcm'

      const consented = await this.promptServiceRoleConsent()
      if (!consented) {
        throw new Error('User declined service_role key storage')
      }
      await this.recordConsent('service_role_keys')
    }

    // Store with project-specific namespace
    await this.store(`service_role:${projectRef}`, key)
  }

  private async store(key: string, value: string): Promise<void> {
    // Try OS keychain (best option)
    try {
      await keytar.setPassword(this.SERVICE_NAME, key, value)
      this.log('info', `Stored ${key} in OS keychain`)
      return
    } catch (error) {
      this.log('warn', `OS keychain unavailable: ${error.message}`)
    }

    // Fallback to encrypted file (acceptable)
    const consented = await this.promptEncryptedFileConsent()

    // Derive encryption key from user's credentials
    const salt = crypto.randomBytes(32)
    const masterKey = crypto.pbkdf2Sync(
      this.getUserSecret(), // OS username + UUID
      salt,
      this.PBKDF2_ITERATIONS,

      message: 'Grant permission to retrieve and store service_role key?',
      default: false
    }])

    return response.consent
  }

  private log(level: string, message: string): void {
    // Audit log (never log actual credentials)
    const logPath = path.join(os.homedir(), '.supabase', 'audit.log')
    const entry = {
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      level,
      message,
      cli_version: this.version
    }
    fs.appendFileSync(logPath, JSON.stringify(entry) + '\n')
  }
}
```

### 10.4 Prohibited Practices

**Never Do**:
1. ❌ Store credentials in plaintext files
2. ❌ Hardcode credentials in source code
3. ❌ Log credentials (even redacted)
4. ❌ Transmit over HTTP
5. ❌ Store without user consent (service_role keys)
6. ❌ Silently fall back to insecure storage
7. ❌ Share keys across projects
8. ❌ Use weak encryption (< AES-256)

### 10.5 Final Recommendation

```

**Key Principles**:
1. **Security First**: OS keychain is non-negotiable default
2. **User Control**: Explicit consent for sensitive operations
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Encrypted file fallback, not plaintext
4. **Transparency**: Clear warnings and documentation
5. **Compliance**: Meets OWASP, NIST, GDPR, CCPA standards
6. **Auditability**: Log all credential access (not credentials themselves)

**Timeline**:
- **Immediate**: Remove any plaintext storage
- **Phase 1** (Week 1): Implement OS keychain storage
- **Phase 2** (Week 2): Add encrypted file fallback
- **Phase 3** (Week 3): Implement consent flows
- **Phase 4** (Week 4): Migrate existing users
- **Phase 5** (Ongoing): Documentation, testing, audit

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Zero plaintext credentials stored
- ✅ All credentials in OS keychain or encrypted file
- ✅ User consent obtained before service_role key access
- ✅ Security warnings displayed
- ✅ Documentation complete (SECURITY.md)
- ✅ Passes security audit
- ✅ No legal compliance violations
