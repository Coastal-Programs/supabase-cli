# 🚀 AGENT BRIEF: RAPID-PROTOTYPER (YOU!)
## Phase 2B - Coordination, Integration & Delivery

**Role**: Orchestration Lead & Quality Guardian
**Timeline**: 1-2 hours spread throughout day (4 × 15min check-ins + 2 hours documentation)
**Responsibility**: Monitor agents, verify quality gates, deliver final product

---

## YOUR MISSION

You are the **Coordination Lead** for Phase 2B. Your job is NOT to write code, but to:
1. Monitor all 3 agents working in parallel
2. Run tests every check-in (verify coverage)
3. Alert on any blockers immediately
4. Ensure quality gates are met
5. Update documentation
6. Generate final completion report

---

## DAILY SCHEDULE (YOU)

### 9:00 AM - Kickoff
- [ ] Share all 4 agent briefs:
  - Agent 1 → AGENT_BRIEF_PHASE2B_BACKEND.md
  - Agent 2 → AGENT_BRIEF_PHASE2B_TESTING.md
  - Agent 3 → AGENT_BRIEF_PHASE2B_PERFORMANCE.md
  - Agent 4 → This brief (you read this)

- [ ] Tell all agents: **"Phase 2B starts NOW. Follow your brief."**

- [ ] Verify agents understand:
  - Agent 1 knows they're implementing 17 commands
  - Agent 2 knows they're writing 60+ tests
  - Agent 3 knows they're benchmarking
  - You know you're coordinating

---

### 10:00 AM - CHECK-IN 1 (Status Review - 15 min)

**Your Tasks**:
1. Ask Agent 1: "How many commands created so far?"
2. Ask Agent 2: "How many tests written so far?"
3. Ask Agent 3: "Started benchmarking?"
4. Run quick test: `npm test 2>&1 | tail -20`
5. Check if any blockers

**Expected Status**:
- Agent 1: 3-5 commands started
- Agent 2: Test infrastructure in place
- Agent 3: Setting up benchmark files
- No blockers yet

**If Blocker Found**:
- Document it
- Alert all agents
- Ask affected agent for root cause
- Help find solution

---

### 12:00 PM - CHECK-IN 2 (Test Verification - 15 min)

**Your Tasks**:
1. Run full test suite: `npm run test:coverage`
2. Check coverage percentage
3. Look for any test failures
4. Verify TypeScript compiles: `npm run build`

**Success Criteria**:
- All tests passing (0 failures)
- Coverage >= 80% (target maintained)
- Build compiles without errors
- No new TypeScript errors

**If Coverage Drops**:
- Alert Agent 2 immediately
- Ask Agent 1 to pause creating new commands
- Focus on test coverage first

---

### 2:00 PM - CHECK-IN 3 (Midpoint Review - 15 min)

**Your Tasks**:
1. Ask Agent 1: "How many commands completed?" (target: ~12 of 17)
2. Ask Agent 2: "How many tests completed?" (target: ~45 of 60)
3. Ask Agent 3: "Performance benchmarks on track?"
4. Run tests again: `npm test`
5. Check coverage: `npm run test:coverage`

**Midpoint Targets**:
- Agent 1: 60-70% complete (12/17 commands)
- Agent 2: 70-75% complete (45/60 tests)
- Agent 3: In progress with benchmarks
- Coverage: Still >= 80%
- No failures

**If Behind**:
- Adjust expectations with affected agent
- See if other agents can help
- Consider extending timeline slightly

**If Ahead**:
- Celebrate progress
- Ask if additional polish needed
- Prepare for final push

---

### 4:00 PM - CHECK-IN 4 (Final Verification - 15 min)

**Your Tasks**:
1. Ask Agent 1: "All 17 commands complete?"
2. Ask Agent 2: "All 60+ tests written and passing?"
3. Ask Agent 3: "Performance report ready?"
4. Run final test suite: `npm test`
5. Run coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
6. Run build: `npm run build`

**Final Targets** (MUST HAVE):
- ✅ 17 commands implemented
- ✅ All tests passing (0 failures)
- ✅ Coverage >= 80%
- ✅ TypeScript compiles (0 errors)
- ✅ Performance report generated
- ✅ No new warnings

**Quality Gates** (Non-negotiable):
1. **Code Quality**: TypeScript 0 errors, ESLint clean

- Test framework issue? Reference Phase 2A patterns
- Pattern question? Review existing commands
- **Your role**: Unblock and get back on track

### If Agent 2 (Testing) Blocked
- Can't test a command? Check command is fully implemented
- Coverage not climbing? Ensure all error paths tested
- Test framework issue? Review test patterns from Phase 2A
- **Your role**: Verify commands are complete first

### If Agent 3 (Performance) Blocked
- Benchmark fails? Check if command is working
- Performance regression? Investigate with Agent 1
- Report generation issue? Help format results
- **Your role**: Ensure infrastructure for benchmarks exists

### If YOU are Blocked
- Ask the agents for help
- Check CLAUDE.md for patterns

## REFERENCE MATERIALS

**If you need to help agents**:
- Check CLAUDE.md for command patterns
- Review Phase 2A implementation for examples
- Look at src/commands/ for existing patterns
- Check test/ directory for test patterns
- Read docs/ for architecture details

---

## YOUR ROLE IN 3 BULLET POINTS

1. **Monitor**: Check progress every 2 hours (4 check-ins)
2. **Verify**: Run tests, check coverage, watch for blockers
3. **Deliver**: Update docs, generate report, celebrate completion

---

## EXPECTED TIMELINE

```
9:00 AM   ← Agents start
10:00 AM  ← Check-in 1 (Status) - 15 min
12:00 PM  ← Check-in 2 (Tests) - 15 min
2:00 PM   ← Check-in 3 (Midpoint) - 15 min
4:00 PM   ← Check-in 4 (Final) - 15 min
5:00 PM   ← YOU: Documentation (2 hours)
7:00 PM   ← 🎉 COMPLETE

Total: 1 day, all quality gates met
```

---

## FINAL NOTE

This is a proven model from Sprint 4 + Phase 2A. All agents know what to do. Your job is to:

1. **Keep them informed** (check-ins)
2. **Keep them unblocked** (solve problems)
3. **Keep quality high** (verify gates)
4. **Keep moving** (encourage progress)

If any agent gets stuck, you escalate. If coverage drops, you alert. If everything's working, you celebrate and let them work.

**You got this. Phase 2B will be complete by 5 PM.** ✅
