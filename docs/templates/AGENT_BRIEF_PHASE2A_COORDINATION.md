## YOUR MONITORING CHECKLIST

### Daily Checklist (repeat 4 times)

- [ ] Run `npm test`
- [ ] Check output for failures
- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage`
- [ ] Verify 82%+ coverage
- [ ] Ask each agent for status
- [ ] Document in status update
- [ ] Alert on blockers

### Build Verification

```bash
# Full build verification
npm run build && npm test && npm run test:coverage
```

This should output:
```
‚úì Build successful (0 errors)
‚úì Tests passing (340+ total, 0 failures)
‚úì Coverage: 82%+ maintained
```

### Blocker Resolution Protocol

If something blocks an agent:

**Identify**:
1. Ask agent: "What's blocking you?"
2. Understand the issue
3. Check if it's in your control

**If you can help**:
- Provide guidance from CLAUDE.md
- Reference existing patterns
- Share similar command examples

**If agent needs to pivot**:
- Suggest alternative approach
- Ensure it aligns with quality standards
- Move to next task

**If technical issue**:
- Check TypeScript compilation
- Verify supabase.ts has required methods
- Check test setup/teardown

## TIME TRACKING

You're spending:
- 10 AM: 15 min (check-in 1)
- 11 AM: 15 min (check-in 2)
- 2 PM: 15 min (check-in 3)
- 4 PM: 15 min (check-in 4)
- 5 PM-7 PM: 2 hours (documentation + final report)

**Total: ~2.5 hours** of your day focused on coordination.

---

## COMMUNICATION STYLE

Be professional but efficient:
- ‚úÖ "Status?" (fast)
- ‚úÖ "Coverage good?" (quick check)
- ‚úÖ "Blocker? How can I help?" (supportive)
- ‚ùå "Detailed architectural discussion" (not now)
- ‚ùå "Code review back-and-forth" (agents handle their code)

---

## READY?

Your job is to ensure smooth execution and coordinate delivery. You're the conductor of this orchestra.

**Let's get Phase 2A smashed out! üéØ**
