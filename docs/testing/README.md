## Test Coverage

### Current Metrics
- ✅ **87%** - Overall test coverage
- ✅ **24K+** - Lines of test code
- ✅ **100%** - Critical path coverage
- ✅ **67** - Commands tested

### Coverage by Category
- **Commands**: 100% (67/67 commands)
- **Core Utilities**: 95%
- **API Wrapper**: 90%
- **Error Handling**: 100%
- **Cache System**: 95%
- **Retry Logic**: 100%

## Test Organization

### Unit Tests
Located in `test/`:
- Command tests (`test/commands/`)
- Utility tests (`test/utils/`)
- Core component tests
- Error handling tests

### Integration Tests
Located in `test/integration/`:
- Multi-command workflows
- End-to-end scenarios
- API integration tests
- Cross-feature testing

### Performance Tests
Located in `test/performance/`:
- Startup time tests
- Command execution benchmarks
- Memory profiling
- Load testing

## Testing Tools

### Frameworks
- **Mocha** - Test runner
- **Chai** - Assertions
- **Sinon** - Mocking and stubbing
- **nyc** - Code coverage

### Commands
```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:coverage       # Run with coverage report
npm run test:watch          # Watch mode
npm run test:performance    # Performance tests only
```

## Testing Strategies

### 1. Unit Testing
- Test individual functions and methods
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on edge cases
- Validate error handling

### 2. Integration Testing
- Test command workflows
- Validate API integration
- Test cache behavior
- Verify error propagation

### 3. Performance Testing
- Measure execution times
- Profile memory usage
- Test cache effectiveness
- Validate performance targets

### 4. Regression Testing
- Prevent performance degradation
- Ensure bug fixes persist
- Validate refactoring
- Cross-version compatibility

## Test Quality Standards

### All Tests Must:
- ✅ Have clear, descriptive names
- ✅ Test one thing at a time
- ✅ Be independent and isolated
- ✅ Be deterministic (no flaky tests)
- ✅ Clean up after themselves
- ✅ Include both happy path and error cases

### Code Coverage Requirements:
- ✅ **100%** - Critical paths (auth, errors)
- ✅ **90%+** - Core functionality
- ✅ **80%+** - Utilities and helpers
- ✅ **70%+** - Edge cases and error handling

## Known Issues and Limitations

Documented in test reports:
- API endpoint limitations
- Test environment constraints
- Mocking challenges
- Performance testing variability

## Test Maintenance

### Regular Tasks:
1. Update tests when adding features
2. Remove obsolete tests
3. Refactor for clarity
4. Update mocks to match API changes
5. Review coverage gaps

### Quality Checks:
- Run full test suite before commits
- Review coverage reports
- Check for flaky tests
- Validate performance benchmarks
