# 🚀 PHASE 2B START HERE
## Operations-Critical Sprint - Backup, Recovery, Advanced Features

**Created by**: Chen (Claude Code)
**Status**: 🟢 READY TO EXECUTE
**Timeline**: 1-2 Days (Aggressive)
**Objective**: Backup (8) + Advanced DB Features (4) + Network & Security (5) = 17 commands

---

## WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO

You said: **"Move onto the next phase"**

Phase 2B delivers **operations-critical features** that enterprise customers need:
- ✅ 17 new commands (800+ lines)
- ✅ 60+ new tests (all passing)
- ✅ 80%+ coverage maintained
- ✅ Production-grade quality
- ✅ Complete documentation

Using the proven 4-agent orchestration from Sprint 4 + Phase 2A.

---

## WHY PHASE 2B MATTERS

Phase 2A was developer-focused (storage, auth, integrations). **Phase 2B is operations-focused**:

| Phase | Focus | Users | Priority |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| **Phase 2A** | Developer Features | Developers | ✅ DONE |
| **Phase 2B** | Operations Features | DevOps, SREs | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **Phase 2C** | Advanced Features | Power Users | 🟡 NICE-TO-HAVE |

Enterprise customers **demand**:
- Backup & recovery (production safety)
- Read replicas (scalability)
- Network security (compliance)
- Database configuration (performance)

## THE PLAN ROADMAP

### 📚 READ FIRST (Choose One)

**Option A - Visual Overview** (2 min)
→ Read: `PHASE_2B_VISUAL_SUMMARY.txt`
→ Then: Launch

**Option B - Understand Why** (5 min)
→ Read: `PHASE_2B_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md`
→ Then: Review agent briefs

**Option C - Just Execute** (Right Now)
→ Skip docs, launch agents with briefs
