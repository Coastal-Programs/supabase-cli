## PARALLEL EXECUTION STRATEGY

**All 4 agents work simultaneously:**

```
9 AM     KICK OFF ‚Üí All agents start in parallel
           ‚Üì
10 AM    CHECK-IN 1 (Agent status review)
           ‚Üì
12 PM    CHECK-IN 2 (Progress + test run)
           ‚Üì
AGENTS CONTINUE WORKING (no interruption)
           ‚Üì
2 PM     CHECK-IN 3 (Midpoint review)
           ‚Üì
AGENTS CONTINUE WORKING
           ‚Üì
4 PM     CHECK-IN 4 (Final verification)
           ‚Üì
