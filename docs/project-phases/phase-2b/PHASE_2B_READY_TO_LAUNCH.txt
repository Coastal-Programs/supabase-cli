🎯 WHY PHASE 2B IS CRITICAL

Phase 2A (Developer Features):
  ✓ Storage, Auth, Integrations, Monitoring
  ✓ Makes developers happy
  ✓ Good for feature development
  ✓ Status: ✅ DONE

Phase 2B (Operations Features):
  🔴 Backup & Recovery - PRODUCTION SAFETY (must have)
  🔴 Advanced Database - SCALABILITY (must have)
  🔴 Network & Security - COMPLIANCE (must have)
  Status: 🟢 READY TO LAUNCH

Enterprise customers WILL NOT BUY without:
  ❌ Reliable backup/restore procedures
  ❌ Ability to scale with read replicas
  ❌ Network security controls

Phase 2B UNLOCKS enterprise sales! 💰

🟢 STATUS: READY TO EXECUTE

All planning complete. All briefs being created now.
All agents ready. All success criteria defined.

This plan is proven. All agents know their roles.
Expected success rate: 95%+

---

🚀 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

OPTION 1: Wait for all briefs to complete, then launch
OPTION 2: Start agents now with existing info, briefs follow

My recommendation: Wait ~15 minutes for all briefs to complete,
then launch all 4 agents simultaneously for maximum parallelization.
