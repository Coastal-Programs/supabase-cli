## THE PLAN AT A GLANCE

You asked: "Could you orchestrate a plan for Sprint 4 with specialized sub-agents to get an even better result?"

**Answer**: YES! I've created a **4-agent orchestration strategy** with specialized briefs for each agent:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SPRINT 4: MULTI-AGENT EXECUTION (5 days, parallel work)   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                              │
│  🏗️ Agent 1: backend-architect                             │

## HOW TO EXECUTE THIS PLAN

### Before You Launch the Agents

1. **Read each brief** (10 minutes)
   - You already have them all

2. **Share the briefs** with each agent
   - Each gets their specific brief
   - Agent 4 (rapid-prototyper) is YOU

3. **Kickoff conversation** (~5 minutes)
   - "We're executing a 4-agent Sprint 4 plan"
   - "Here's your brief with specific deliverables"
   - "Report progress daily EOD"
   - "I'm orchestrating & integrating all work"

4. **Start agents in parallel** (or sequentially based on availability)
   - Agent 1 can start immediately
   - Agent 2 can start immediately (parallel)
   - Agent 3 can start once Agent 1 has initial code
   - You coordinate throughout

### Daily Execution Pattern

**For Each Agent**:
```
Task Execution:
├─ Start: <agent brief + specific day's tasks>
├─ Work: [Agent works on deliverables]
├─ End: Report progress, list blockers
└─ You: Verify integration, unblock if needed

Your Job (15-30 min/day):
├─ Run: npm test
├─ Run: npm run test:coverage
├─ Track: Progress from all agents
├─ Alert: On regressions or blockers
└─ Communicate: Status to user
```

### End of Sprint Delivery

```
Deliverables Package:
├─ 5 working commands (726 lines)
├─ 69 passing tests (new)
├─ 294 total tests passing
├─ 82% code coverage
├─ Performance report
├─ SPRINT_4_COMPLETE.md
├─ Updated README.md
├─ Updated CLAUDE.md
└─ Command reference docs
```

## WHY THIS APPROACH WORKS

### 1. Specialization
Each agent has **one clear focus** with specific deliverables and success criteria. No ambiguity.

### 2. Parallelization
All agents work **simultaneously**. No waiting for others to finish first.
- While Agent 1 codes, Agent 2 writes tests
- While Agent 2 tests, Agent 3 benchmarks
- You coordinate all three

### 3. Clear Metrics
**Daily verification** ensures quality:
- Tests passing? ✅
- Coverage >= 80%? ✅
- No regressions? ✅
- Build clean? ✅

### 4. Proven Pattern
This mirrors how Notion CLI was built - 3 layers (API + infrastructure + commands) with specialized teams focusing on their domain.

### 5. Risk Mitigation
- **Daily integration testing** catches issues immediately
- **Clear blockers list** allows fast resolution
- **MVP definition clear** (15 commands, 80% coverage)
- **Fallback plans** if any agent needs help

---

## EXPECTED OUTCOME

### Success Scenario ✅
```
Day 5 EOD:
├─ ✅ 15 commands working (100% MVP)
├─ ✅ 294 tests passing (100% pass rate)
├─ ✅ 82% coverage (exceeds 80%)
├─ ✅ 0 compilation errors
├─ ✅ Documentation complete
└─ ✅ Ready for Sprint 5 (production hardening)
```

### At-Risk Scenario 🟡
```
If coverage drops below 80% on Day 3:
├─ Stop new work
├─ Agent 2 focuses on coverage
├─ Agent 1 helps debug
├─ Recover by EOD Day 4
└─ Continue with buffers
```

### Fallback Plan 🔴
```
If any agent gets stuck:
├─ You (Chen) help debug
├─ Reassign work if needed
├─ Use buffer time (built-in 5-day timeline)
├─ Extend individual agent if needed
└─ Ensure MVP is met
```

## YOUR ROLE AS QUARTERBACK 🏈

As the rapid-prototyper coordinator:

**You Don't**:
- Write the commands (Agent 1 does)
- Write the tests (Agent 2 does)
- Benchmark performance (Agent 3 does)

**You Do**:
- ✅ Monitor all 3 agents daily
- ✅ Run integration tests daily
- ✅ Unblock issues immediately
- ✅ Communicate status clearly
- ✅ Update documentation
- ✅ Deliver final report
- ✅ Ensure MVP quality gates

**Time Commitment**:
- 15-30 minutes/day for coordination
- 2-3 hours EOD Day 5 for documentation
- ~10-12 hours total across 5 days
