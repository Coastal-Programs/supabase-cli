---

## QUICK START (TODAY)

### Step 1: Share the Briefs (2 min)
Send each agent their brief:
```
Agent 1 → AGENT_BRIEF_BACKEND_ARCHITECT.md
Agent 2 → AGENT_BRIEF_TEST_WRITER_FIXER.md
Agent 3 → AGENT_BRIEF_PERFORMANCE_BENCHMARKER.md
Agent 4 (You) → AGENT_BRIEF_RAPID_PROTOTYPER.md
```

### Step 2: Start Agents (Day 1)
```
Agent 1: "Implement 5 commands following your brief"
Agent 2: "Fix failing tests + write 69 tests"
Agent 3: "Setup performance test framework"
Agent 4 (You): "Monitor, verify, coordinate"
```

### Step 3: Daily Execution (Days 1-5)
**Every day, you**:
1. Run: `npm test` (verify all tests pass)
2. Run: `npm run test:coverage` (verify 80%+ coverage)
3. Check: Progress from all 3 agents
4. Alert: On blockers or regressions
5. Send: Daily status update

### Step 4: Deliver (Day 5)
```
Generate: SPRINT_4_COMPLETE.md
Update: README.md, CLAUDE.md
Create: docs/COMMAND_REFERENCE.md
Verify: 15 commands, 80% coverage, 0 failures
Ship: MVP ready! 🎉
```

## COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: Do I need to read all the documents?**
A: No! Start with SPRINT_4_VISUAL_SUMMARY.txt, then your brief (AGENT_BRIEF_RAPID_PROTOTYPER.md)

**Q: What if an agent gets stuck?**
A: You (Chen) help debug. Use the detailed briefs to understand what they should do.

**Q: How do I know if we're on track?**
A: Daily: check `npm test` passes + `npm run test:coverage` shows >= 80%

**Q: What if coverage drops below 80%?**
A: Alert immediately. Agent 2 stops new work and focuses on coverage recovery.

**Q: How do I send daily status?**
A: Use the template in AGENT_BRIEF_RAPID_PROTOTYPER.md

**Q: What if we can't hit 15 commands by Day 5?**
A: Unlikely (proven pattern, clear specs). But fallback: extend to Day 6 if needed.
