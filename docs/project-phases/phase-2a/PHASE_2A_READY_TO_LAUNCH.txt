📋 KEY PRINCIPLES (From Sprint 4 Success)

✅ Parallel Execution      - All agents work simultaneously
✅ Daily Integration       - Run tests every 1-2 hours
✅ Clear Specialization    - Each agent knows their role
✅ Quality Gates           - Non-negotiable minimums (82% coverage, 0 failures)
✅ Blocker Resolution      - Fast unblock mechanism
✅ Proven Patterns         - Copy from Sprint 4 success
✅ Communication Template  - Daily status updates

⚠️ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Coverage Must Stay 82%+**
   If drops, Alert Agent 2 immediately for recovery plan

2. **Tests Must Pass (0 Failures)**
   Any failure = stop, debug, fix before continuing

3. **Build Must Compile (0 Errors)**
   TypeScript strict mode = no compromises

4. **Commands Must Work**
   Manual testing before calling complete

5. **Documentation Must Update**
   No shipping without updated README + CLAUDE.md

🟢 STATUS: READY TO EXECUTE

All planning complete. All briefs written. All success criteria defined.

This plan is proven (based on Sprint 4 success). All agents know their roles.
Expected success rate: 95%+
