# 🚀 PHASE 2A START HERE
## Critical Features Sprint - Storage, Auth, Integrations, Monitoring

**Created by**: Chen (Claude Code)
**Status**: 🟢 READY TO EXECUTE
**Timeline**: 1 Day (Aggressive)
**Objective**: Storage (6) + Auth (8) + Integrations (5) + Monitoring (8) = 27 commands

## WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO

You said: **"Let's get a plan out and we'll get this smashed out today."**

I'm building a 1-day sprint that delivers:
- ✅ 27 new commands (1,200+ lines)
- ✅ 80+ new tests (all passing)
- ✅ 82%+ code coverage maintained
- ✅ Production-grade quality
- ✅ All GitHub CLI standards met

Using the same 4-agent orchestration that crushed Sprint 4.

## THE PLAN ROADMAP

### 📚 READ FIRST (Your Choice)

**Option A - Just Launch It** (2 min)
→ Read: `PHASE_2A_VISUAL_SUMMARY.txt`
→ Then: Start the agents

**Option B - Understand Why** (5 min)
→ Read: `PHASE_2A_EXECUTIVE_BRIEF.md`
→ Then: Review agent briefs

**Option C - Full Details** (10 min)
→ Read: `PHASE_2A_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md`
→ Then: Share briefs with agents

## YOUR 4-AGENT TEAM (Same as Sprint 4)

### 🏗️ Agent 1: backend-architect
**Mission**: Implement 27 commands (~1,200 lines)
**Deliverable**: Production code, all patterns followed
**Brief**: `AGENT_BRIEF_PHASE2A_BACKEND.md`

### 🧪 Agent 2: test-writer-fixer
**Mission**: Write 80+ tests, maintain 82%+ coverage
**Deliverable**: Comprehensive test suite, all passing
**Brief**: `AGENT_BRIEF_PHASE2A_TESTING.md`

### ⚡ Agent 3: performance-benchmarker
**Mission**: Benchmark new commands, verify performance
**Deliverable**: Performance report, optimization recommendations
**Brief**: `AGENT_BRIEF_PHASE2A_PERFORMANCE.md`

### 🚀 Agent 4: rapid-prototyper (YOU!)
**Mission**: Coordinate, integrate, deliver report
**Deliverable**: Daily coordination, final documentation
**Brief**: `AGENT_BRIEF_PHASE2A_COORDINATION.md`

## HOW THIS WORKS

**Same as Sprint 4 - Proven Model**

1. **Parallel Execution**: All 4 agents work simultaneously
2. **Daily Integration**: Run `npm test` and `npm run test:coverage` each check-in
3. **Blocker Resolution**: Fast unblock if anything blocks
4. **Quality Gates**: Non-negotiable minimums (82% coverage, 0 failures)
5. **Final Delivery**: Complete report at EOD

---

## AGENT BRIEFS (Share These)

Each agent gets ONE brief with everything they need:

```
Agent 1 → AGENT_BRIEF_PHASE2A_BACKEND.md
Agent 2 → AGENT_BRIEF_PHASE2A_TESTING.md
Agent 3 → AGENT_BRIEF_PHASE2A_PERFORMANCE.md
Agent 4 → AGENT_BRIEF_PHASE2A_COORDINATION.md (you read this)
```

---

## YOUR ROLE (Agent 4)

### Do NOT
❌ Write the commands (Agent 1)
❌ Write the tests (Agent 2)
❌ Benchmark (Agent 3)

### Do
✅ Monitor all 3 agents
✅ Run `npm test` every 1-2 hours
✅ Check coverage stays 82%+
✅ Alert on failures immediately
✅ Coordinate any blockers
✅ Update README/CLAUDE.md
✅ Deliver final report

**Time**: ~15 min per check-in × 6 check-ins = 90 min coordination total

---

## READY?

Let's get this smashed out. 🎯

**Status**: 🟢 READY TO EXECUTE
**Expected Success**: 95%+
**Delivery Time**: Today, EOD
**Quality**: Production Grade

**Next Step**:
1. Read PHASE_2A_VISUAL_SUMMARY.txt (2 min)
2. Share the 4 agent briefs
3. Launch all agents NOW
